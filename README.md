# Elegance E-commerce — From Code to Cloud

## 🛍️ Introduction

**Elegance** is a cloud-native e-commerce web application designed with a modern tech stack and robust DevOps practices. The goal wasn't just to build an application, but to deploy it in a highly available, cost-effective, and secure manner — taking the project from *code* to *cloud* seamlessly.

Developed by a collaborative team (Adham, Maha, Mahmoud, and Heba), this project showcases how a full-stack application can be built and deployed with containerization, CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, and modern monitoring techniques.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Build a responsive and visually appealing e-commerce frontend  
- ✅ Develop a scalable and secure backend API  
- ✅ Containerize the application for consistent environments  
- ✅ Automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment  
- ✅ Implement CI/CD pipelines for efficient development  
- ✅ Monitor the application and infrastructure in real time

## 🧭 Implementation Plan

### 🧠 1. Brainstorming & Requirements
- Defined the project scope, objectives, and features
- Chose the appropriate technologies and architecture

### 📄 2. Documentation & Design
- Designed the system architecture and chose the infrastructure components
- Prepared UI mockups and frontend structure

### 💻 3. Development
- Built the frontend using **React-Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Developed the backend with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB Atlas**
- Used **Cloudinary** to manage and serve static assets cost-effectively

### 📦 4. Containerization
- Containerized frontend and backend using **Docker**
- Optimized Dockerfiles with `.dockerignore` for faster builds and smaller image sizes

### ☁️ 5. Infrastructure as Code
- Provisioned infrastructure using **Terraform**
- Used **Ansible** to automate server configuration and app deployment

### ⚖️ 6. Load Balancing & Reverse Proxy
- Set up **Nginx** on the frontend server to:
  - Serve the app
  - Act as a reverse proxy and load balancer for two backend servers
  - Handle custom error pages and fault tolerance

### 🔄 7. CI/CD Pipelines
- Built GitHub Actions workflows for:
  - Infrastructure provisioning and destruction
  - Docker image creation and deployment
- Managed secrets with **GitHub Secrets** for secure credentials

### 📊 8. Monitoring
- Integrated **Prometheus** for collecting metrics
- Used **Grafana** for real-time visualization and custom dashboards
